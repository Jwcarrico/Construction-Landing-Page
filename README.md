# Will Carrico: Personal Website

## Motivation

This website is intended to serve as a platform to display various projects that I've worked on. These projects span across topics including design, copy writing, and web development.

As an added bonus, building this site has been an opportunity to improve upon my web development skills and overcome all obstacles involved in publishing a website.

## Methods

After researching all aspects of planning, building and publishing a site, I decided to use the following methods.

### Site Design:
All iterations of the site's design were created in **Figma**.

### Development:
Aside from initial tinkering with site elements on codepen.io, all code was written in **Visual Studio Code**.

The site was built entirely using **HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript**.

### Hosting:
This site is hosted (for free) on **GitHub Pages**.

### Registrar:
The domain name (willcarrico.com) was purchased through **Google Domains**.

### Security and Optimization:
**Cloudflare** is integrated to secure the site and well as optimize page load times.

### Analytics:
This site is utilizing **Google Analytics** to track all basic site data.

## Cost

The total cost of publishing and maintaining this site is **$12 per year**, the only necessary cost being the domain name. 

As a previous customer of Squarspace, I initially found the contrast between $144/year and $12/year incredibly attractive. Obviously there is quite a bit of a learning curve and extra work involved in building a site from scratch. However, there are a ton of free resources out there (like the ones listed above) that make building a site very cost efficient.

## Timeline

***9-1-20***
Published initial version of willcarrico.com without project pages in order to work out the kinks and test on various devices.

***8-19-20***
Secured and optimized site using Cloudflare.

***8-17-20***
Transferred domain name to Google Domains. 

I found that I like the user friendliness of Google Domains compared to Amazon Web Services and didn't find it pragmatic to continue bumbling through Amazon's platform.

***8-5-20***
Migrated all existing code from codepen.io to a locally hosted folder and began writing code in Visual Studio Code.

***7-17-20***
Began initial iterations of the site design in Figma as well as initial development of web elements on codepen.io.

***4-22-20***
Domain willcarrico.com re-purchased using Amazon Web Services. (I had previously owned the domain through Squarespace, but let it expire months prior).

## Credits

At the point of originally publishing this site, I have learned everything I know about HTML, CSS and web development principles from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course along with various supplemental resources.
